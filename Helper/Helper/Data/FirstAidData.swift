enum Firstaid: String, Equatable {
    case Choking = "If the person is able to cough forcefully, the person should keep coughing. \nIf the person is choking and can't talk, cry or laugh forcefully, use “Five-and-Five” approach: \n- Give 5 back blows. \n- Stand to the side behind a choking adult. For a child, kneel down behind. \n- Place one arm across the person's chest for support. \n- Bend the person over at the waist so that the upper body is parallel with the ground. \n- Deliver five separate back blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. \n- Give 5 abdominal thrusts. \n- Perform five abdominal thrusts. \n- Alternate between 5 blows and 5 thrusts until the blockage is dislodged."
    case Bleeding = "Wash your hands or put on disposable gloves, if possible. This can help protect you from diseases like viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. \nRinse the wound with water. \nCover the wound with a gauze or cloth (towel, blanket, clothing, whatever's available). \nApply direct pressure to stop the blood flow and encourage clotting, which is when blood naturally thickens to stop blood loss. \nIf possible, elevate the bleeding body part above the heart. \nDon't remove the cloth if it becomes soaked through, but add more layers if needed. \nRemoving the first layer will interfere with the clotting process and result in more blood loss. \nOnce bleeding has stopped, apply a clean bandage. \nGet medical help if: \n- The wound is deep. \n- The wound has widely separated sides. \n- The injury oozes blood after pressure has been applied. \n- The injury is from an animal or human bite. \n- The injury is a puncture, burn, or electrical injury. \n- You suspect arterial bleeding. \n- Blood is soaking through bandages. \n- Bleeding won't stop"
    case Burns = "Major burns need emergency medical attention. Call 112 or get someone else to call once the burning process has been stopped. \nFor other burns, take these first aid steps: \n- Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes. \n- Do not use ice. \n- Apply a light gauze bandage. (You may apply an ointment, like aloe vera, before doing so if the burn is minor.) \n- Take Motrin (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief, if necessary. \n- Do not break any blisters that may have formed. \nThe severity of a burn is based on its depth and size: \n- First-degree burn: This affects only the outer layer of skin and causes redness and swelling. It is considered a minor burn. \n- Second-degree burn: This affects two layers of skin and causes blistering, redness, and swelling. It is considered a major burn if it's more than three inches wide or is on the face, hands, feet, genitals, buttocks, or over a major joint. \n- Third-degree burn: This affects deeper layers of skin and causes white or blackened skin that may be numb. It is always considered a major burn."
    case BrokenBone = "Call 112 immediately if: \n- The person is bleeding profusely, is unresponsive, not breathing, or has numerous injuries. \n- You suspect a fracture or other serious injury to the spinal column, head, hip, pelvis, or thigh. In this case, the person should not be moved except by trained medical personnel. \n- A broken bone protrudes from the skin, known as an open or compound fracture. \n- The area below an injured joint feels cold and clammy or becomes bluish. \n- You can't immobilize the injury well enough to transport the person. \nIf these don't apply, use first aid and then go to an urgent care or contact your healthcare provider for guidance. Don't try to straighten the bone. \nFor a limb, use a splint and padding to keep it still and elevate it. Put a cold pack on the injury, with a barrier between it and the skin to prevent tissue damage. If ice is all that's available, put it in a plastic bag and wrap it in a shirt or towel. Give anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil (ibuprofen) or Aleve (naproxen) for pain."
    case Sprains = "The first thing to do is make sure the injured person stops any unnecessary activity so they don't make the injury worse. Sprains often don't require emergency treatment. However, you should get immediate medical care if the injured person has: \n- Severe pain with movement or touch. \n- Ongoing inability to bear weight on the injured joint. \n- Increased bruising. \n- Numbness or pins-and-needles near the sprain. \n- Signs of infection. \n- Little or no improvement during the first week. \nIf they don't, begin first aid: \n- Keep the limb still. \n- Apply a cold pack. \n- Elevate the injured part if you can do so safely. \n- Use NSAIDs for pain. \nSee your healthcare provider soon after for further treatment."
    case NoseBleeds = "First aid for nosebleed includes: \n- Lean slightly forward, not back. \n- Pinch the nose just below the bridge, high enough that the nostrils aren't pinched closed. \n- Check after five minutes to see if bleeding has stopped. \n- If not, continue pinching and check after another 10 minutes. \n- You can also apply a cold pack to the bridge of the nose while pinching. \nSee a healthcare provider if: \n- You get frequent nosebleeds. \n- You have anemia symptoms like weakness, faintness, fatigue, and pale skin. \n- You're taking blood thinners. \n- You have a clotting disorder. \n- You just started a new medication. \n- You also have unusual bruising. \nA nosebleed needs emergency medical treatment when: \n- It won't stop even after more than 15 minutes of direct pressure. \n- There is a lot of blood loss. \n- You have a hard time breathing. \n- You've swallowed a lot of blood and vomited it up. \n- You've had a serious injury or a blow to the head"
    case BeeStings = "Call 112 immediately or get the person to the hospital if any signs of allergy appear. \nIf the person who was stung has a known allergy to bee stings, use an EpiPen to prevent anaphylaxis. \nIn someone without a known bee allergy, watch for signs of an allergy while performing first aid: \n- Get the stinger out any way you can to keep it from injecting more venom. The method doesn't matter. What's most important is that this is done quickly. \n- Wash the area with soap and water. \n- Use a cold pack to reduce swelling at the site, but don't apply ice directly to the skin. \n- Use an allergy medication, or antihistamine, like Benadryl to reduce swelling and itching. \n- Use Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Advil (ibuprofen) for pain."
    case Hypothermia = "Hypothermia is caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. It begins to occurs when your body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit. \nSymptoms of hypothermia include: \n- Shivering \n- Slurred speech or mumbling \n- Week pulse \n- Weak coordination \n- Confusion \n- Red, cold skin \n- Loss of consciousness. \nTo treat hypothermia: \n- Be gentle with the afflicted person. \n- Don’t rub their body and don’t move their body in too jarring of a way; this could trigger cardiac arrest. \n- Move the person out of the cold, and remove any wet clothing. \n- Cover the person with blankets and use heat packs. Don’t apply heat directly to the skin because this could cause major skin damage. \n- Give the person warm fluids. \nIf you set the person on the ground, be aware that the ground may also be a cold source. Place warm materials on the ground that the person is going to lay on."
    case Allergy = "Allergic reactions occur when your body is hypersensitive to a foreign substance. Bee stings, certain foods, or drug ingredients can cause allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can be caused by all of those mention allergens. \nThe best way to treat an allergic reaction is to use an EpiPen. EpiPen, or “epinephrine autoinjector,” is a small and ergonomic needle that’s used to inject epinephrine (adrenaline) into someone suffering greatly from an allergic reaction. The epinephrine usually subdues the effects of the allergic reaction. \nIf someone is suffering from an allergic reaction: \n- Keep the person calm. \n- Ask if they use an EpiPen and have one with them. \n- Have the person lie on their back. \n- Keep their feet elevated 12 inches. \n- Make sure the person’s clothing is loose so they’re able to breathe. \n- Avoid giving them food, drink, or medicine. \n- If appropriate, learn how to inject an EpiPen in someone having a reaction. \n- Wait 5-15 minutes after using an EpiPen. \nIf the allergic reaction isn’t subdued, a second dose may be required."
    case Stroke = "A stroke may cause loss of balance or unconsciousness, which may result in a fall. If you think you or someone around you may be having a stroke, follow these steps: \n- Call emergency services. If you’re having stroke symptoms, have someone else call for you. Stay as calm as possible while waiting for emergency help. If you’re caring for someone else having a stroke, make sure they’re in a safe, comfortable position. Preferably, this should be lying on one side with their head slightly raised and supported in case they vomit. \n- Check to see if they’re breathing. If they’re not breathing, perform CPR. \n- If they’re having difficulty breathing, loosen any constrictive clothing, such as a tie or scarf. \n- Talk in a calm, reassuring manner. \n- Cover them with a blanket to keep them warm. \n- Don’t give them anything to eat or drink. \n- If the person is showing any weakness in a limb, avoid moving them. \n- Observe the person carefully for any change in condition. \n- Be prepared to tell the emergency operator about their symptoms and when they started. \n- Be sure to mention if the person fell or hit their head."
    case HeartAttack = "Have the person sit down, rest, and try to keep calm. \nLoosen any tight clothing. \nAsk if the person takes any chest pain medicine, such as nitroglycerin for a known heart condition, and help them take it. \nIf the pain does not go away promptly with rest or within 3 minutes of taking nitroglycerin, call for emergency medical help. \nIf the person is unconscious and unresponsive, call 112 or the local emergency number, then begin CPR. If an infant or child is unconscious and unresponsive, perform 1 minute of CPR, then call 112 or the local emergency number. \nChewing and swallowing a full dose aspirin is recommened, after calling 112 or the local emergency number. Only do this if you are not allergic to aspirin and do not have any condition that could make taking aspirin dangerous for you. \nThe 112 operator can help you decide whether or not to take aspirin. \nDO NOT\n- DO NOT leave the person alone except to call for help, if necessary. \n- DO NOT allow the person to deny the symptoms and convince you not to call for emergency help. \n- DO NOT wait to see if the symptoms go away. \n- DO NOT give the person anything by mouth unless a heart medicine (such as nitroglycerin) has been prescribed."
    case ElectricShock = "Call 112 or your local emergency number if the injured person experiences: \n- Severe burns \n- Confusion \n- Difficulty breathing \n- Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) \n- Cardiac arrest \n- Muscle pain and contractions \n- Seizures \n- Loss of consciousness. \nTake these actions immediately while waiting for medical help: \n- Turn off the source of electricity, if possible. If not, move the source away from you and the person, using a dry, nonconducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood. \n- Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement. \n- Try to prevent the injured person from becoming chilled. \n- Apply a bandage. \n- Cover any burned areas with a sterile gauze bandage, if available, or a clean cloth. Don't use a blanket or towel, because loose fibers can stick to the burns."
    case Drowning = "If you pull someone from the water and they are unresponsive follow these steps: \n- Check for breathing. \n- Tilt their head back and look, listen and feel for breaths. \n- If they are not breathing, move on to the following steps. \n- Tell someone to call 112 for emergency help. \nGive five rescue breaths: \n- Tilt their head back, sealing your mouth over their mouth. \n- Pinch their nose and blow into their mouth. \n- Repeat this five times. \nGive 30 chest compressions. \n- Push firmly in the middle of their chest and then release. \n- Repeat this 30 times. \n- Give two rescue breaths then continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until help arrives."
    case Poisoning = "Call 112 or your local emergency number immediately if the person is: \n- Drowsy or unconscious \n- Having difficulty breathing or has stopped breathing \n- Uncontrollably restless or agitated \n- Having seizures \n- Known to have taken medications, or any other substance, intentionally or accidentally overdosed (in these situations the poisoning typically involves larger amounts, often along with alcohol). \nTake the following actions until help arrives: \n- Swallowed poison: Remove anything remaining in the person's mouth. If the suspected poison is a household cleaner or other chemical, read the container's label and follow instructions for accidental poisoning. \n- Poison on the skin: Remove any contaminated clothing using gloves. Rinse the skin for 15 to 20 minutes in a shower or with a hose. \n- Poison in the eye: Gently flush the eye with cool or lukewarm water for 20 minutes or until help arrives. \n- Inhaled poison: Get the person into fresh air as soon as possible. \nIf the person vomits, turn his or her head to the side to prevent choking. \nBegin CPR if the person shows no signs of life, such as moving, breathing or coughing. \nHave somebody gather pill bottles, packages or containers with labels, and any other information about the poison to send along with the ambulance team."
